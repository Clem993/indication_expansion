Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,Neurology,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,8,Yes,"Phase 2 trials ongoing (SAR443820/DNL788). Strong genetic evidence linking RIPK1-mediated necroptosis to motor neuron death. OPTN and TBK1 mutations in familial ALS dysregulate RIPK1."
Multiple Sclerosis,Neurology,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,7,Yes,"Phase 2 trials with SAR443820. RIPK1 activation observed in MS lesions. Necroptosis contributes to oligodendrocyte death and demyelination."
Alzheimer's Disease,Neurology,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,7,Yes,"Clinical development ongoing. RIPK1 activation found in AD brain tissue. Microglial RIPK1 drives neuroinflammation and synapse loss."
Ulcerative Colitis,Gastroenterology,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,Yes,"Phase 2 trials (SAR443122/DNL758). Intestinal epithelial necroptosis drives barrier dysfunction. TNF-mediated cell death central to pathology."
Rheumatoid Arthritis,Immunology,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,7,Yes,"Phase 2 completed (GSK2982772). RIPK1 drives synovial inflammation. TNF pathway central to RA pathogenesis."
Psoriasis,Dermatology,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,Yes,"Phase 2 trials (GSK2982772). Keratinocyte necroptosis observed in psoriatic lesions. TNF inhibitors already effective in psoriasis."
Crohn's Disease,Gastroenterology,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,6,Yes,"Phase 1 for IBD completed. Paneth cell necroptosis implicated. Similar TNF-driven pathology to ulcerative colitis."
Parkinson's Disease,Neurology,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,6,Yes,"Preclinical evidence strong. Dopaminergic neuron necroptosis observed. LRRK2 mutations may interact with RIPK1 signalling."
Sepsis,Critical Care,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,5,Partial,"Preclinical models show benefit. RIPK1-mediated organ damage in systemic inflammation. Compound 21 (ZB-R-55) shows promise in animal models."
Stroke (Ischaemic),Neurology,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,5,Partial,"Preclinical evidence. Neuronal necroptosis in ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Nec-1s protective in animal stroke models."
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,Immunology,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,5,Partial,"Emerging evidence. Phase 2 trial in cutaneous lupus (SAR443122). Interferon-driven inflammation may involve RIPK1."
Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis,Hepatology,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,5,Partial,"Preclinical evidence. Hepatocyte necroptosis drives liver inflammation and fibrosis. TNF pathway implicated in NASH progression."
Traumatic Brain Injury,Neurology,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,4,Partial,"Preclinical only. Secondary neuronal death involves necroptosis. Nec-1 protective in TBI animal models."
Myocardial Infarction,Cardiology,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,No,"Limited evidence. Cardiomyocyte necroptosis in ischaemia-reperfusion. No clinical development planned."
Pancreatic Cancer,Oncology,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,No,"Phase 1/2 trials discontinued (GSK3145095). Conflicting preclinical results. Immunomodulatory effects uncertain."
